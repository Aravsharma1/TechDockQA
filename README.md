🚀 TechDocQA: Retrieval-Augmented QA Assistant for Technical Documentation
🪐 Overview
TechDocQA is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for technical documentation, enabling developers to ask natural language questions about frameworks, libraries, APIs, and SDKs while receiving accurate, source-backed answers. By grounding LLM outputs in up-to-date official documentation, TechDocQA helps developers learn new technologies, debug efficiently, and onboard faster without hallucinations or outdated information.

🎯 Project Goals
✅ Enable developers to upload documentation files (Markdown, PDF, HTML, OpenAPI specs) via a user-friendly UI.
✅ Parse, chunk, and embed documentation into a vector database for fast, semantic retrieval.
✅ Allow users to ask questions in natural language and receive grounded, clear, and reference-backed answers from the documentation.
✅ Build a clean UI for uploading files and querying the documentation interactively.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: FastAPI, LangChain/LangGraph, OpenAI API (or Groq/Ollama), Chroma/FAISS/Qdrant (vector store).

Frontend (MVP): Streamlit or Next.js (clean UI for upload + chat).

Parsing: PyMuPDF for PDFs, markdown-it-py or BeautifulSoup for Markdown/HTML.

LLM: GPT-4o (or local models for testing).

Version Control: GitHub.

⚡ MVP Scope
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will focus on:
✅ A frontend UI allowing documentation upload.
✅ Backend ingestion pipeline to parse, chunk, embed, and store documentation.
✅ A simple chat interface for users to ask questions and receive LLM-based answers grounded in retrieved documentation chunks.
✅ Display of source references in responses for trust and traceability.

❌ No multi-agent workflows yet.
❌ No MCP integration.
❌ No finetuning.
❌ No Chrome or VS Code extension.

🌱 Future Extensions
1️⃣ Multi-Agent Layer (LangGraph)
Add structured agents for:

Intent classification (QA, summarization, comparison).

Planning retrieval strategies.

Advanced multi-step reasoning over technical documentation.

Example: Retrieve code snippets + explanations simultaneously.

2️⃣ MCP Integration
Use Multi-Agent Control Plane (MCP) to manage, scale, and monitor multiple agents in parallel, enabling high-concurrency workloads, enterprise scaling, and robust orchestration across large documentation corpora.

3️⃣ Finetuning (Optional)
Instruction-tune open-weight LLMs on curated Q&A pairs generated from your documentation to improve style and consistency while retaining retrieval for factual grounding.

4️⃣ Chrome Extension
Allow developers to:

Highlight and query documentation on official sites (React, FastAPI, etc.).

Retrieve contextually grounded answers without switching contexts.

Optionally extend to a VS Code extension for in-editor assistance.

5️⃣ Multimodal & Graph Enhancements
Future advanced enhancements can include:

Figure/code diagram linking.

Multimodal retrieval over diagrams and text.

Graph-based retrieval for heading-based context expansion.

✅ Why TechDocQA?
While general-purpose LLMs can answer documentation questions, they often:
❌ Provide outdated or hallucinated information.
❌ Cannot handle private/internal documentation.
❌ Lack version-specific accuracy and citation-backed references.

TechDocQA solves these problems by grounding answers in up-to-date, relevant documentation, improving accuracy, reliability, and developer trust.

🚀 Example Queries
“How do I define a router in FastAPI?”
“How does React handle state updates?”
“What is the Kubernetes Deployment rolling update strategy?”
“How to authenticate with this API using OAuth2?”

📈 Current Status
 UI for uploading documentation: planned.

 Backend ingestion and vector DB integration: planned.

 RAG pipeline for retrieval and QA: planned.

 Testing and refinement: upcoming.

🚦 Next Steps (for project execution)
✅ Finalize backend ingestion and RAG pipeline.
✅ Build and test the UI for uploads + chat queries.
✅ Tune retrieval parameters and prompts for clarity.
✅ Plan integration of multi-agent orchestration, MCP, finetuning, and Chrome extension after MVP completion.
